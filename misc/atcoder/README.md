> I recommend you should solve problem E and F (especially 700-900 points problem in AtCoder) 
> of AtCoder Regular Contest, especially ARC058-ARC090. 
> Though old AtCoder Regular Contests are balanced for “considering” and “typical”, 
> but sadly, AtCoder Grand Contest and recent AtCoder Regular Contest problems are actually too biased for considering I think, 
> so I don’t recommend if your goal is gain rating in Codeforces. (Though if you want to gain rating more than 2600, you should solve problems from AtCoder Grand Contest)
